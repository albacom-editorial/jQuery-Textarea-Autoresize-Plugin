Simple jQuery plugin to add vertical autoresize functionality
to textareas. Tested and working on Chrome 7, Safari 4,
Firefox 3.6 and MSIE6.

Basic usage:
$('textarea').autoresize();

You can change some settings to make the plugin work as you
want it to:

$('textarea').autoresize({ animate: false });


All options:

onresize: 	function
			a function that gets called when the textarea
			has been resized
buffer:		float, default: 1
			number of extra lines to add to the textarea
			(keep this over 0 to avoid the textarea jumping)
minRows:	float, default: 4
			the minimal amount of rows to reduce the
			textarea to
animate: 	true/false, default: true
			whether or not to animate the resizing of the
			textarea
animationDuration: microseconds, default: 50
			duration of animation
resizeOnStart: true/false, default: false
			whether or not to resize the textarea when
			the plugin is activated
